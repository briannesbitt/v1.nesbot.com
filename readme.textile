*This site is no longer maintained.  The final version here is built on Play framework v1.2.3.  I have ported this blog to the BETA release of Play 2.0.*

*The version built on the BETA release of Play 2.0 can be seen here: "http://github.com/briannesbitt/v2.nesbot.com":http://github.com/briannesbitt/v2.nesbot.com*

*I have since rewritten it again using the "Slim Framework":http://slimframework.com and that version can be seen here: "https://github.com/briannesbitt/nesbot.com":https://github.com/briannesbitt/nesbot.com*

I am making the source code of my personal site available publicly in case it helps anybody.  It's developed using the "playframework":http://playframework.org.  At this point it's so simple it probably won't, but hopefully it will in the not too distant future.
